# Monte Carlo Sign Problem Skill

> **Note**  
> This skill makes judgments and rankings only from metadata such as the paper title, abstract, keywords, arXiv categories, and year.  
> It does not assume the full text is read or understood; all conclusions must explicitly express uncertainty.

## Research Goals

### G1: Origin / Cause of the Sign Problem

**Description**  
Focus on the physical or formal sources of the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), including Fermi statistics, geometric frustration,
non-positive-definite weights, basis dependence, and non-stoquastic Hamiltonians.

**Positive signals**
- sign problem  
- fermionic  
- negative weight  
- complex weight  
- phase problem  
- frustration  
- basis dependence  
- non-stoquastic  

**Negative signals**
- classical Monte Carlo  
- no sign problem  

---

### G2: Mitigation, Avoidance, or Use of the Sign Problem

**Description**  
Focus on methods that mitigate, avoid, or reformulate the sign problem,
including reweighting, constrained path, fixed-node, dual representations, machine-learning-assisted methods,
and work that treats the sign or average sign as physical information.

**Positive signals**
- reweighting  
- sign mitigation  
- alleviate sign problem  
- constrained path  
- fixed-node  
- meron-cluster  
- dual representation  
- machine learning  
- neural network  
- variational Monte Carlo  

**Negative signals**
- exact diagonalization only  
- purely analytical  

---

### G3: Relation Between the Sign Problem and Phase Transitions / Criticality

**Description**  
Study the relationship between sign-problem strength (e.g., average sign) and physical phase transitions, quantum critical behavior,
topological phases, or changes in phase structure.

**Positive signals**
- phase transition  
- quantum critical  
- critical point  
- order parameter  
- topological phase  
- average sign  
- sign average  

**Negative signals**
- finite-size only  
- algorithm performance only

## Classification Criteria (Metadata Only)

### Survey / Meta
**Criteria**
- Title or abstract includes *review / survey / perspective*
- Citation count is significantly higher than peers from the same period
- Covers multiple models or methods

---

### Theory
**Criteria**
- Emphasizes the origin, intractability, or computational complexity of the sign problem
- Contains terms like *theorem, proof, NP-hard, complexity*
- Has little or no emphasis on numerical experiments

---

### Method
**Criteria**
- Proposes a conceptual or framework-level method
- Performance comparisons or scaling are not the core focus
- Common terms: *framework, approach, formulation*

---

### Algorithm
**Criteria**
- Clearly proposes or improves a specific algorithm
- Emphasizes efficiency, scaling, or numerical stability
- Contains keywords like *scaling, efficiency, speedup*

---

### Benchmark / Dataset
**Criteria**
- Clearly proposes a benchmark or dataset
- Includes systematic comparisons across multiple methods or models
- May mention open-source implementations or standard evaluation workflows

---

### Application
**Criteria**
- Focuses on a specific physical model or system (e.g., Hubbard, spin liquid)
- The sign problem is a computational obstacle rather than the research core
- The goal is to obtain physical conclusions about the system

---

## Scoring Heuristics

- **Relevance (0.5)**  
  Whether metadata directly or repeatedly mentions core terms like sign problem, average sign, etc.

- **Importance (0.3)**  
  Whether the work is broadly applicable across models, methods are transferable, or it is frequently cited in later work.

- **Recency (0.2)**  
  Give additional weight to newer directions, for example:
  - machine learning and the sign problem
  - non-stoquastic Hamiltonians
  - intersections with quantum computing or quantum algorithms

---

## Uncertainty Output Requirements

- All judgments must use wording like “possibly / likely / inferred from the abstract.”
- Do not claim “the paper proves/shows” unless the title or abstract explicitly states so.
